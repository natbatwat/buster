##Hello Digitas! 

### Sudo Code
```html
# think of cool name for bus app
# try getting some data from API
# integrate GoogleMaps API 
# add Geolocation
# add search bar
```


### Things I've Learned Along The Way! 
- "YUI" module pattern for an alternative to declaring global variables
    + Had this problem when I wanted to access variables or results within individual googlemaps functions while maintaining modular code 


###If I had more time...
